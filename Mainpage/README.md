Main page and navbar for newarkkidscode.org by Ben Schack.

**Please not that file names cannot have spaces in them because they cannot be run locally.**

I am running this locally off a mac. For the links to work, you will probably have to change them.

Special features:
  -navbar compresses when page gets smaller.
  -most elements automatically resize.


Problems:
  -Some page compression issues.
  -Main page form does not do anything yet.
  -active class will not stick on load.
