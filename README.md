  > Underscoring our mission to promote social and economic self-sufficiency for disadvantaged residents, the Urban League of Essex County is committed to exploring innovative and effective strategies to help lift people out of poverty. Given how inextricably linked skill development is with access to economic opportunity, both education and employment opportunities play key roles in helping bring our organizational goals to fruition. 
  
  >With this reality in mind, the mission of Newark Kids Code is to create the next generation of software engineers, and use coding as a tool to teach all students to be computational thinkers, positioning them for sustained professional success in a modern economic landscape.
